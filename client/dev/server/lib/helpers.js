      <h3>SCHEDULE</h3>\
      <p>Please refer to our online calendar for your training schedule. Your group dates, times and location for the upcoming training period are posted on this schedule. Any changes due to scheduling conflicts, weather or other unforeseen circumstances will be posted here as well. Please be sure to check the schedule prior to your training sessions at all times.</p> \
      <h3>WHAT TO EXPECT</h3>\
      <p>If this is your first session, welcome aboard! When you arrive to your first session, we will introduce you to everyone and let you know who you will be working with to get you acquainted with the program. You will be shown the basics and instructed through every step of the process. If this is your first experience with vaulting, relax, we move very slow, with easy to execute fundamental movements and work you up from there one step at a time. During a typical training session, we will go through a warmup and equipment setup, before we move into the lesson.</p>\
      <h3>WHAT TO BRING</h3>\
      <p>Dress in comfortable athletic clothing. Bring regular running shoes and some water to drink. If you are training at one of our outdoor locations (like DCV), bring sunblock as well as extra water.</p>\
      <h3>LOCATION</h3>\
      You selected a specific training location when you registered. This is your assigned group location. Address information can be found on our website in the Facilities section</p>\
      <h3>WORKOUTS</h3>\
      <p>If you want to progress as quickly as possible, conditioning is very important. We\'ve attached our general team conditioning program. It\'s a 12 week program for our athletes to follow outside of scheduled practices. We strongly encourage every athlete to complete this workout in total. If you do, your progress will accelerate significantly.</p>\
      <p>If you have any questions that have not been answered, please email our administrative assistant, Lauren, at <a href="mailto:lrose@dcvault.org">LRose@DCVault.org</a>\
      <p>Again, thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you soon.</p>',
